## Questions

### Sequence 1


### Sequence 2

1. Parris is frightened and angered because Betty is dead and he is being disturbed by Tituba. He probably thinks that if his slave disturbs him, his prayer will probably be useless.
2. He knows that Abigail went into the forest with friends and that they sang arround a fire as a ritual. He thinks that Abigail and her friends may have woken up spirits who may have killed Betty. He knows that his "enemies" will state that Abigail and her friends are witches and try to make people believe he is part of the scheme.
3. She says she was playing with Betty and her friends.

### Sequence 3

1. They resent Parris because they see that Betty is inert and they know the girls were dancing in the forest.
2. They are petty, they dislike the Reverand and they want to have revenge. They are happy when they say that Betty was doing witchcraft because it would end Parris' career
3. They believe that they were calling the spirits by dancing around a fire and speaking in a foreign language 

### Sequence 4

1. We learn that the girls were lying and that they were trying to wake up the dead (Ruth's sisters).
2. We learn that Abigail doesn't really care about the punishment but takes care of Betty. We also learn that she drank blood in the forest.
3. The girls wanted to kill Goody Proctor, this shows us that they are sadistic and either supersticious (believe in witchcraft) or mock it (know its fake and are playing around it)

### Sequence 5

1. We learn that Proctor is a feared and respected man. He is dominant and insults Mary when he sees her in the room.
2. When Proctor enters the room, Abigail goes from serious with Mercy and Betty because she knows that they are suspected of witchcraft, to trying to be relaxed because she doesn't want to raise suspicion into Proctor because she knows he is powerful and that they tried to invoke demons to kill him.
3. Proctor may be said to have behaved badly towards Abigail because he hold her firmly and threatened to hit her and admited he thought of her "softly".
4. She might use this as an excuse for what they were doing in the forest.

## Answers

### Sequence 2

1. Betty is inert and he doesn’t know why but knows that people will think is witch-craft
2. Knows that Betty and her friends were dancing in the forest, and says he saw a naked girl running around, saw Tituba (Parris’ slave) doing « magic ».
3. She said that they were just doing sport (no harm, just playing)

Betty pretends to be inert to not have to tell the truth to her father.

Is suspicious about Abigail because she was thrown out of her ex-owners house and has never been « called » again. Her name was also soiled. She has the ability to pretend, she is not trustworthy
