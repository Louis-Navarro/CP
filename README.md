# CP

A repository containing all of my Competitive Programming related files

## Tree
* Single files (such as `HackerRank.py/cpp` or `France-IOI.py`) are to write answers to problemset on the platforms.
* Competitions folders (such as `Codeforces Round *` or `Atcoder Beginner Contest *`) are folders containing the answers to the problems of the contest.
* `template.*` Files with predefined variables/functions to write code faster.
